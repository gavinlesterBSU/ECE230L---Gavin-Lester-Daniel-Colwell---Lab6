## Lab Questions
### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
You can add more than two bits together by chaining multiple full adders, depending on how many are needed.
### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
XOR gates in adders are important because they are essential to handle binary addition. XOR
gates only output 1 when the two inputs are different, which is the same behaviour that is
followed when adding bits. It specifically handles the cases: (0+1) and (1+0).
### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
The largest number that can be represented by two bits is 3. Going over causes overflow, which is indicated by the carry-out.
